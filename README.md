Based on your requirements, here are my key architectural recommendations:

1. Multi-tenant Architecture:
  - Each tattoo artist gets their own subdomain (e.g., artist1.yourplatform.com)
  - This allows for better SEO and branding while maintaining a single codebase

2. Landing Pages Structure:
  - Main platform landing page for your business
  - Individual artist landing pages generated from their profiles
  - These can be statically generated with Next.js for better performance

3. Client Access Strategy:
  - PWA serves as the main client platform
  - Artists can be discovered through search/browse within the PWA
  - Users stay within the same PWA when switching artists
  - Artist-specific features only in iOS app

4. Authentication Flow:
  - Centralized authentication service
  - Email validation against artist backoffice registrations
  - JWT-based session management

5. Infrastructure Considerations:
  - Kubernetes on GCP (or alternatives like Digital Ocean/Linode for cost optimization)
  - CDN for static assets and gallery images
  - gRPC for efficient communication between services

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or focus on a specific part of the architecture?

Here’s a Mermaid diagram that visualizes your proposed app ecosystem based on your considerations, followed by some thoughts on your additional questions. The diagram reflects the separation of the tattoo artist iOS app, the client PWA, the backoffice, and the landing pages, along with the tech stack and infrastructure.

Explanation of the Diagram
Tattoo Artist App (iOS Only):
Built natively for iOS, with features tailored to artists (e.g., Apple Pencil support, Procreate integration) if the survey confirms Apple dominance.
Paired with a Next.js backoffice for artists to manage their profiles, galleries, and client interactions.
Client PWA:
A Progressive Web App (PWA) accessible via custom URLs (e.g., artistname.example.com) for each tattoo artist.
Features include contacting the artist, viewing galleries, and managing workflows (e.g., booking, design previews).
Login restricted to emails configured in the artist’s backoffice—clients not in the system can’t access it.
Backoffice:
Front-end in Next.js for artists to configure their network (e.g., adding client emails, setting up galleries).
Backend in Go with gRPC and Postgres for fast, scalable communication and data storage.
Deployed via Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or a cheaper alternative (e.g., DigitalOcean, Linode).
Landing Pages:
A main business landing page (e.g., yourcompany.com) to promote your app ecosystem.
Optional artist-specific landing pages (e.g., artistname.yourcompany.com)—more on this below.
Addressing Your Questions
Should Each Client PWA Have a Customized Address for Each Tattoo Artist?
Yes, customizing the PWA URL per artist (e.g., artistname.example.com) makes sense:
Branding: It gives each artist a personalized, professional web presence tied to your ecosystem.
User Experience: Clients can bookmark their artist’s specific PWA, streamlining access.
Implementation: Use subdomains or path-based routing (e.g., example.com/artistname) with a single PWA codebase that dynamically loads artist-specific data based on the URL.
What If a Client Wants to See a Different Tattoo Artist? Should It Be a Different Web Address?
There are two approaches:
Single PWA with Artist Switching:
Clients access one PWA (e.g., clients.example.com) and can browse or search for other artists within it.
Pros: Simpler for clients—no need to know multiple URLs; encourages discovery of new artists.
Cons: Less personalized; might feel less exclusive to individual artists.
Separate URLs per Artist:
Clients visit a new URL (e.g., otherartist.example.com) to switch artists.
Pros: Reinforces artist branding; aligns with your custom URL idea.
Cons: Clients need to know or find the new URL, which could be a friction point.
Recommendation: Start with custom URLs per artist for branding and simplicity, but include a “Discover Other Artists” feature within the PWA. This could link to a directory (e.g., example.com/artists) or redirect to other artist PWAs. Avoid forcing clients to manually hunt for new URLs—make switching seamless.
Should Tattoo Artists Also Have Their Own Landing Page?
It depends on your goals:
Yes, if branding matters: A landing page (e.g., artistname.yourcompany.com) could serve as a public portfolio, showcasing the artist’s work, bio, and a link to download the PWA or contact them. It’s a marketing tool separate from the app ecosystem.
No, if the PWA suffices: The custom PWA URL could double as their online presence, reducing redundancy and maintenance.
Recommendation: Lean toward yes—artist landing pages enhance professionalism and SEO (each artist gets indexed by search engines). Keep them lightweight (static Next.js pages) and linked to the PWA. Clients could land there first, then install the PWA for deeper interaction.
Your Business Landing Page
Absolutely, you should have a landing page (e.g., yourcompany.com):
Purpose: Explain your ecosystem, attract artists to join, and guide clients to the network.
Content: Highlight the iOS app for artists, the PWA for clients, and a call-to-action (e.g., “Find an Artist” or “Join as an Artist”).
Tech: Build it with Next.js for consistency with the backoffice.
Tech Stack and Infra Thoughts
Go + gRPC + Postgres: Solid choice. Go is fast and efficient, gRPC scales well for microservices, and Postgres is reliable for structured data like artist profiles and galleries.
Kubernetes on GCP: Great for scalability and management, though GCP can get pricey. Alternatives like DigitalOcean Kubernetes ($12/node/month) or Linode (similar pricing) could save costs early on. Test with a small cluster first—Kubernetes shines when you need to scale, not at MVP stage.
Final Thoughts
Your setup—iOS app for artists, PWA for clients, Next.js backoffice, and Go-powered backend—is well-structured. Custom PWA URLs per artist with optional landing pages strike a balance between personalization and usability. Start lean: build the iOS app and a single PWA with one artist’s URL, deploy on a cheap cloud (e.g., DigitalOcean), and iterate based on feedback. Does this align with your vision, or is there anything else you’d like to tweak?

### **Considerations & Answers to Your Questions**
1. **Tattoo Artists Own Their Platform (iOS + Backoffice)**
  - **Native iOS App** for managing clients, bookings, messaging, and file sharing.
  - **Backoffice (Next.js)** to configure the experience, set up pricing, handle CRM, and view analytics.
  - **Custom Landing Page** for marketing their services (optional but recommended).

2. **Clients Use a PWA for Interactions**
  - Clients **only interact** with a tattoo artist through a **custom PWA** that is **configured through the artist's backoffice**.
  - **Custom URLs for each artist**:
    - Example: `artist-name.tattooapp.com`
    - Clients can only log in if invited or onboarded by an artist.
  - The PWA supports:
    - Viewing artist portfolio & gallery.
    - Booking appointments.
    - Chatting or video calling the artist.

3. **What If a Client Wants to See a Different Artist?**
  - Should **clients have one dashboard with access to multiple artists**?
  - Or should they switch between separate web addresses?
  - Possible Approaches:
    - **Approach 1: Separate PWA for Each Artist**
      - Clients use unique URLs like `john.tattooapp.com` and `sara.tattooapp.com`.
      - If they want another artist, they visit their URL separately.
    - **Approach 2: Unified Client Dashboard**
      - Clients have **one login** and can switch between different artists inside the same dashboard.
      - This makes sense **if clients often work with multiple artists**.

   **→ Recommendation:** Start with separate PWA URLs (approach 1), but if demand grows, offer a unified experience later.

4. **Should Tattoo Artists Have Their Own Landing Page?**
  - **Yes, they should.**
  - Tattoo artists should be able to **customize their# SyncInk Tattoo Artist Client Management SaaS

Based on your requirements, here are my key architectural recommendations:

1. Multi-tenant Architecture:
- Each tattoo artist gets their own subdomain (e.g., artist1.yourplatform.com)
- This allows for better SEO and branding while maintaining a single codebase

2. Landing Pages Structure:
- Main platform landing page for your business
- Individual artist landing pages generated from their profiles
- These can be statically generated with Next.js for better performance

3. Client Access Strategy:
- PWA serves as the main client platform
- Artists can be discovered through search/browse within the PWA
- Users stay within the same PWA when switching artists
- Artist-specific features only in iOS app

4. Authentication Flow:
- Centralized authentication service
- Email validation against artist backoffice registrations
- JWT-based session management

5. Infrastructure Considerations:
- Kubernetes on GCP (or alternatives like Digital Ocean/Linode for cost optimization)
- CDN for static assets and gallery images
- gRPC for efficient communication between services

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or focus on a specific part of the architecture?

Here’s a Mermaid diagram that visualizes your proposed app ecosystem based on your considerations, followed by some thoughts on your additional questions. The diagram reflects the separation of the tattoo artist iOS app, the client PWA, the backoffice, and the landing pages, along with the tech stack and infrastructure.

Explanation of the Diagram
Tattoo Artist App (iOS Only):
Built natively for iOS, with features tailored to artists (e.g., Apple Pencil support, Procreate integration) if the survey confirms Apple dominance.
Paired with a Next.js backoffice for artists to manage their profiles, galleries, and client interactions.
Client PWA:
A Progressive Web App (PWA) accessible via custom URLs (e.g., artistname.example.com) for each tattoo artist.
Features include contacting the artist, viewing galleries, and managing workflows (e.g., booking, design previews).
Login restricted to emails configured in the artist’s backoffice—clients not in the system can’t access it.
Backoffice:
Front-end in Next.js for artists to configure their network (e.g., adding client emails, setting up galleries).
Backend in Go with gRPC and Postgres for fast, scalable communication and data storage.
Deployed via Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or a cheaper alternative (e.g., DigitalOcean, Linode).
Landing Pages:
A main business landing page (e.g., yourcompany.com) to promote your app ecosystem.
Optional artist-specific landing pages (e.g., artistname.yourcompany.com)—more on this below.
Addressing Your Questions
Should Each Client PWA Have a Customized Address for Each Tattoo Artist?
Yes, customizing the PWA URL per artist (e.g., artistname.example.com) makes sense:
Branding: It gives each artist a personalized, professional web presence tied to your ecosystem.
User Experience: Clients can bookmark their artist’s specific PWA, streamlining access.
Implementation: Use subdomains or path-based routing (e.g., example.com/artistname) with a single PWA codebase that dynamically loads artist-specific data based on the URL.
What If a Client Wants to See a Different Tattoo Artist? Should It Be a Different Web Address?
There are two approaches:
Single PWA with Artist Switching:
Clients access one PWA (e.g., clients.example.com) and can browse or search for other artists within it.
Pros: Simpler for clients—no need to know multiple URLs; encourages discovery of new artists.
Cons: Less personalized; might feel less exclusive to individual artists.
Separate URLs per Artist:
Clients visit a new URL (e.g., otherartist.example.com) to switch artists.
Pros: Reinforces artist branding; aligns with your custom URL idea.
Cons: Clients need to know or find the new URL, which could be a friction point.
Recommendation: Start with custom URLs per artist for branding and simplicity, but include a “Discover Other Artists” feature within the PWA. This could link to a directory (e.g., example.com/artists) or redirect to other artist PWAs. Avoid forcing clients to manually hunt for new URLs—make switching seamless.
Should Tattoo Artists Also Have Their Own Landing Page?
It depends on your goals:
Yes, if branding matters: A landing page (e.g., artistname.yourcompany.com) could serve as a public portfolio, showcasing the artist’s work, bio, and a link to download the PWA or contact them. It’s a marketing tool separate from the app ecosystem.
No, if the PWA suffices: The custom PWA URL could double as their online presence, reducing redundancy and maintenance.
Recommendation: Lean toward yes—artist landing pages enhance professionalism and SEO (each artist gets indexed by search engines). Keep them lightweight (static Next.js pages) and linked to the PWA. Clients could land there first, then install the PWA for deeper interaction.
Your Business Landing Page
Absolutely, you should have a landing page (e.g., yourcompany.com):
Purpose: Explain your ecosystem, attract artists to join, and guide clients to the network.
Content: Highlight the iOS app for artists, the PWA for clients, and a call-to-action (e.g., “Find an Artist” or “Join as an Artist”).
Tech: Build it with Next.js for consistency with the backoffice.
Tech Stack and Infra Thoughts
Go + gRPC + Postgres: Solid choice. Go is fast and efficient, gRPC scales well for microservices, and Postgres is reliable for structured data like artist profiles and galleries.
Kubernetes on GCP: Great for scalability and management, though GCP can get pricey. Alternatives like DigitalOcean Kubernetes ($12/node/month) or Linode (similar pricing) could save costs early on. Test with a small cluster first—Kubernetes shines when you need to scale, not at MVP stage.
Final Thoughts
Your setup—iOS app for artists, PWA for clients, Next.js backoffice, and Go-powered backend—is well-structured. Custom PWA URLs per artist with optional landing pages strike a balance between personalization and usability. Start lean: build the iOS app and a single PWA with one artist’s URL, deploy on a cheap cloud (e.g., DigitalOcean), and iterate based on feedback. Does this align with your vision, or is there anything else you’d like to tweak?

### **Considerations & Answers to Your Questions**
1. **Tattoo Artists Own Their Platform (iOS + Backoffice)**
- **Native iOS App** for managing clients, bookings, messaging, and file sharing.
- **Backoffice (Next.js)** to configure the experience, set up pricing, handle CRM, and view analytics.
- **Custom Landing Page** for marketing their services (optional but recommended).

2. **Clients Use a PWA for Interactions**
- Clients **only interact** with a tattoo artist through a **custom PWA** that is **configured through the artist's backoffice**.
- **Custom URLs for each artist**:
  - Example: `artist-name.tattooapp.com`
  - Clients can only log in if invited or onboarded by an artist.
- The PWA supports:
  - Viewing artist portfolio & gallery.
  - Booking appointments.
  - Chatting or video calling the artist.

3. **What If a Client Wants to See a Different Artist?**
- Should **clients have one dashboard with access to multiple artists**?
- Or should they switch between separate web addresses?
- Possible Approaches:
  - **Approach 1: Separate PWA for Each Artist**
    - Clients use unique URLs like `john.tattooapp.com` and `sara.tattooapp.com`.
    - If they want another artist, they visit their URL separately.
  - **Approach 2: Unified Client Dashboard**
    - Clients have **one login** and can switch between different artists inside the same dashboard.
    - This makes sense **if clients often work with multiple artists**.

**→ Recommendation:** Start with separate PWA URLs (approach 1), but if demand grows, offer a unified experience later.

4. **Should Tattoo Artists Have Their Own Landing Page?**
- **Yes, they should.**
- Tattoo artists should be able to **customize their page**, showcase their work, and link to their booking/PWA.
- You can auto-generate simple landing pages from their **backoffice settings**.

5. **Should You Have a Business Landing Page?**
- **Absolutely.**
- The **main business landing page** will:
  - Explain the benefits to tattoo artists.
  - Offer subscription plans.
  - Showcase testimonials & case studies.
  - Include a **marketplace/discovery feature** in the future.

6. **Technology & Infrastructure**
- **Backend:** Go + gRPC + PostgreSQL.
- **Deployment:** Kubernetes (GKE) or a cheaper alternative like Hetzner Cloud.
- **Storage:** Cloud Storage for image & video assets.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana for insights.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based auth with OAuth 2.0 (Google/Apple logins).

---

### **Next Steps**
- **Market Study:** Validate iOS-only vs. cross-platform decision.
- **Prototype the Backoffice:** Start with Next.js, connecting to the gRPC backend.
- **Test the PWA Approach:** Decide on the separate PWA vs. unified experience.
- **Infrastructure Planning:** Set up Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and observability.

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Multi-Region Setup
```yaml
regions:
  - name: us-east1
    primary: true
    services: all
  - name: eu-west1
    primary: false
    services: [user, biometric, mental-health]
```

- Handle data residency requirements
- Implement geo-specific features
- Manage multi-region sync

### 2. Scaling Strategy
```yaml
autoscaling:
  biometric_service:
    min_replicas: 3
    max_replicas: 10
    metrics:
      - type: cpu
        target: 70
  ai_service:
    min_replicas: 2
    max_replicas: 8
    metrics:
      - type: custom
        name: model_queue_length
        target: 100
```
- Set up service-specific scaling
- Implement predicative scaling
- Handle burst capacity

# DB SCHEMA

Below is a **recommended relational database schema** for your **SyncInk Tattoo Artist SaaS**. It is designed with **multi-tenant** capabilities (for studios/artists), robust support for **client management**, scheduling, messaging, and a flexible structure for future expansions (e.g., AI features, payment processing, or multi-artist studios).

---

# 1. Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

Below, each table lists **primary keys**, **foreign keys**, and a short rationale. You can adapt the naming to your style and indexing strategy.

```sql
-- 1. studios: The “tenant” or main account for each studio/artist setup
CREATE TABLE studios (

-- 3. clients: End customers of the tattoo studio (i.e. each person wanting tattoos)
CREATE TABLE clients (
    id            UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    studio_id     UUID NOT NULL,

CREATE TABLE conversation_participants (
    conversation_id  UUID NOT NULL,
    user_id          UUID NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (conversation_id, user_id),
    CONSTRAINT fk_conversation
        FOREIGN KEY (conversation_id) REFERENCES conversations (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT fk_user
        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- 7. messages: The actual chat messages
CREATE TABLE messages (
    id                UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

    CONSTRAINT fk_sender_client
        FOREIGN KEY (sender_client_id) REFERENCES clients (id)
);

-- 8. portfolio: For images / design references / completed work

    CONSTRAINT fk_studio_social
        FOREIGN KEY (studio_id) REFERENCES studios (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### **Key Points & Rationale**

1. **`studios`** table:
  - Acts as the “tenant” entity—each studio or single-artist business.
  - Could have additional columns like `plan_type` (e.g., Basic, Professional, etc.), subscription expiration, etc.

2. **`users`** table:
  - Users belong to a studio (`studio_id`).
  - `role` field to differentiate: `OWNER` (the main account), `ARTIST`, or `ASSISTANT`.
  - You could store phone, about, or other staff details here.

3. **`clients`** table:
  - The end customers (people wanting tattoos).
  - Tied to a `studio_id`, so each tenant’s client data is kept separate.

4. **`appointments`** table:
  - Tracks booking times, references the `client_id` and optionally an `artist_id`.
  - Could store deposit info, price, or location fields.

5. **`conversations`** & **`conversation_participants`** & **`messages`**:
  - A flexible approach so you can have multiple staff and a single client in a conversation or even group chats.
  - The `messages` table references either a `sender_user_id` or `sender_client_id` to handle who posted the message.

6. **`portfolio_items`**:
  - Stores the images or references to images for each artist’s portfolio.
  - Could link to external storage (S3 or GCP bucket) via `image_url`.

7. **`social_integrations`**:
  - Optional table for storing OAuth tokens or credentials for external providers (Instagram, WhatsApp).
  - This allows advanced feature expansions like pulling direct messages from Instagram or auto-posting artwork.

## 3. How This Schema Supports Your SaaS

1. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**
   Each `studio` effectively acts as a tenant. You can **enforce** row-based policies or keep each studio’s data siloed by referencing `studio_id` in all relevant tables.

2. **Multiple Staff & Roles**
   The `users` table can hold different roles—**Owner**, **Artist**, or **Assistant**—and you can easily add columns or references for advanced RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

3. **Clients & Appointments**
   Tattoo studios manage all their **clients** in `clients`, schedule them in `appointments`, and link each appointment to an `artist_id`.

4. **Conversations & Messages**
   Real-time or asynchronous chat is supported. **Group conversations** are possible by adding multiple staff in `conversation_participants`.

5. **Portfolios**
   Each **portfolio item** references an `artist_id` (for ownership) and a `studio_id` (to ensure multi-tenant scoping). The `image_url` points to external storage (e.g., GCS or S3).

6. **Social Integrations**
   This table lets you store tokens for Instagram, WhatsApp, etc., enabling you to sync DMs, auto-post artwork, or unify messaging in the future.

---

## 4. Potential Extensions

- **Payment**
  - A `payments` table referencing `appointments` or a separate `invoices` table if you want to track deposits, transaction IDs, or payment status.
- **AI & AR Features**
  - A `design_requests` table where artists can store prompts or references for AI style generation, linking them to a `portfolio_items` once generated.
- **Analytics**
  - A `stats_daily` or “event logging” table for metrics like how many appointments booked, how many messages sent, etc.

---

## 5. Implementation Tips

1. **Schema per Studio** (If you truly want separate schemas for each tenant)
  - You would replicate these tables in each schema. This is more complex to manage but offers ultimate data isolation.
2. **Row-Level Security**
  - Alternatively, you can keep everything in one schema with a `studio_id` foreign key and set up [Postgres Row-Level Security (RLS)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html) to ensure each studio only sees its own data.
3. **Indexes & Performance**
  - Add indexes on `studio_id`, `client_id`, `artist_id`, etc.
  - For texting, you might index `conversation_id` on the `messages` table if queries filter on conversation.
4. **Sharding**
  - If you scale globally, consider sharding by region or storing `region` in `studios`.

### Explanation

1. **Database Schema**
  - **studios**: Each row is a tenant (a single-artist brand or a multi-artist studio).
  - **users**: Staff (owner/artist/assistant) belongs to a single `studio_id`.
  - **clients**: End customers. Linked to `studios`.
  - **appointments**: Ties clients and optionally an `artist_id` (a user with role=ARTIST) for scheduling.
  - **conversations**: Chat threads; each references a `client_id` and the `studio_id`.
  - **conversation_participants**: Many-to-many linking users to a conversation.
  - **messages**: Actual chat entries; either `sender_user_id` or `sender_client_id`.
  - **portfolio_items**: Artwork references for an `artist_id` in a given studio.
  - **social_integrations**: Access tokens for each studio to Instagram, etc.

2. **gRPC Services**
  - **Auth Service**: Creates & authenticates accounts (JWT), belongs to a `studio_id`.
  - **Messaging Service**: Manages conversation creation, message posting, retrieving chat history.
  - **Scheduling Service**: Appointment booking, rescheduling, notifications.
  - **File Mgmt / Portfolio Service**: Upload & manage images or references in `portfolio_items`, possibly integrated with S3/GCS.
  - **Notification Service**: Could push real-time events or email/push notifications for new messages, upcoming appointments.
  - **Integration Service**: Ties into external APIs (Instagram, WhatsApp, Pinterest, etc.)—uses `social_integrations`.

## gRPC / Proto Example (Conceptual)

Below is a conceptual outline of what your `.proto` files might look like for each microservice. (This is not exhaustive, just indicative.)

```proto
// auth_service.proto
service AuthService {
  rpc RegisterUser(RegisterUserRequest) returns (RegisterUserResponse);
  rpc Login(LoginRequest) returns (LoginResponse);
  // ...
}

message RegisterUserRequest {
  string studio_id = 1;
  string email = 2;
  string password = 3;
  // ...
}
message RegisterUserResponse { string message = 1; }

// messaging_service.proto
service MessagingService {
  rpc CreateConversation(CreateConversationRequest) returns (CreateConversationResponse);
  rpc SendMessage(SendMessageRequest) returns (SendMessageResponse);
  rpc StreamMessages(StreamMessagesRequest) returns (stream Message);
  // ...
}

// scheduling_service.proto
service SchedulingService {
  rpc CreateAppointment(CreateAppointmentRequest) returns (CreateAppointmentResponse);
  rpc ListAppointments(ListAppointmentsRequest) returns (ListAppointmentsResponse);
  // ...
}

// portfolio_service.proto
service PortfolioService {
  rpc UploadPortfolioItem(UploadItemRequest) returns (UploadItemResponse);
  rpc ListPortfolioItems(ListPortfolioRequest) returns (ListPortfolioResponse);
  // ...
}
```

These calls would interact with the associated domain logic in the Go code and read/write from the schema above.

---

## Why This Design Works

- **Modular**: Each microservice can focus on a domain—auth, messaging, scheduling, portfolio, etc.
- **Multi-tenant**: The `studio_id` references keep data scoping clear.
- **Future expansions**: Add new microservices for AI features or analytics.
- **Real-time**: With gRPC streaming, you can handle real-time chat or presence events.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Prototyping**: Start with the **Auth** and **User** domain to get multi-tenant user management working.
2. **Messaging**: Build out conversation & message flows so artists can chat with clients.
3. **Scheduling**: Add appointments next, hooking into e.g. email or push notifications.
4. **Deployment**: Containerize each microservice, orchestrate on Kubernetes, implement a gateway for a unified front.

This approach ensures a robust, scalable foundation for your SyncInk Tattoo Artist Client Management platform. You can refine the specifics—table column names, proto message shapes, microservice boundaries—as the project evolves.

These tables illustrate how your SaaS logically organizes data (first table) and which gRPC services interact with specific entities (second table).

## 6. Summary

This schema balances:

- **Tenant isolation** (via `studio_id`).
- **Flexibility** for large or small studios.
- **Chat** with a robust conversation model.
- **Portfolio management** for showcasing artwork.
- **Social media integration** for future expansions.

The **Mermaid ER diagram** shows how these tables relate to each other, ensuring that each piece of data—appointments, messages, designs—is tied back to the correct studio and user.

**Next Steps:**
- Decide whether to store all tenants in one schema with row-level security or use separate schemas for each.
- Integrate with your microservices (Go + gRPC) by creating domain repositories that manage these tables.
- Add advanced features (payments, AI) as additional tables or integrated columns.

This approach should provide a solid, scalable foundation for your **SyncInk** platform. Good luck with the implementation, and feel free to refine relationships or naming conventions to suit your specific business logic!
